# NEAT
Trying to learn the how the NEAT algorithm works (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies)
Feel free to take a look at my code and use it in your projects!
This is just the first version, just with creating and reading the network, no evolution yet. I have implemented some recursion in the compute step to make figuring out what the output nodes are a whole lot easier. Make sure to read the NEAT paper as it took a while for me to grasp the concept. Below are some diagrams to help you.
